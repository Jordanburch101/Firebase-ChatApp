## General info

This project uses Google Firebase to write and listen to data in real-time and then present it as a real-time chat application.
Users can log in securely with their Google account and access the Chatroom.

The Chatroom is loaded using a ternary operator to check whether the user is logged in or not.

Once logged in users can see 25 of the latest messages and then proceed to post in real-time.
